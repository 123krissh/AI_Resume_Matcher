<h1> Building a Job Description and Resume Matching System With Python Using Machine Learning ðŸ¤– </h1>

<p>This project aims to build a job description and resume matching system using Python with machine learning techniques. The system helps streamline the recruitment process by automatically matching job descriptions with submitted resumes, providing recruiters with a more efficient way to identify suitable candidates.</p>

<h2>ðŸ”¥Features : </h2>
<li>Job Description Input: Recruiters can input job descriptions into the system.</li>
<li>Resume Upload: Candidates can upload their resumes for matching against job descriptions.</li>
<li>Matching Algorithm: The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to match job descriptions with resumes based on similarity scores.</li>
<li>Result Presentation: Matched resumes are presented to recruiters with similarity scores and relevant details.</li>

<h2>ðŸ’»Technologies Used :</h2>
<li>Python: Backend development using Python programming language.</li>
<li>Flask: Web framework for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Bootstrap: Frontend design and layout using Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly UI.</li>
<li>Machine Learning Libraries: Libraries such as scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms for text similarity matching.</li>
<li>HTML/CSS: Frontend markup and styling for web pages.</li>
